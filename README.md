# cards
## Premise
An unfinished card game, built with the help of ChatGPT and midjourney.

## Game loop 
On load, the game builds a deck, shuffles it, and draws five cards into the player's hand. The player can drag the cards into the playable area or back into their hand. I haven't built any sort of combat logic or enemy deck.

## Cards

All the cards were generated by ChatGPT and Midjourney.

Roughly, the process was 

- Ask ChatGPT for card name examples
- Ask it to write stats and descriptions for each
- Take those prompts and send them into MidJourney, and take the pictures I liked the most.
- Once I had the list of cards, I had ChatGPT format them as JSON and add them into a Vuex store.
- Some of the vue UI and CSS was also written by ChatGPT.

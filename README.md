# cards
## Premise
An unfinished card game, built with the help of ChatGPT and midjourney.

## Game loop 
On load, the game builds a deck, shuffles it, and draws five cards into the player's hand. The player can drag the cards into the playable area or back into their hand. I haven't built any sort of combat logic or enemy deck.
